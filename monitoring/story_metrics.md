## Block Size  

*cometbft_consensus_block_size_bytes*  

This metric provides the size of individual blocks processed by the node. It reflects the amount of data contained in a single block, such as transactions and other relevant information. Monitoring block size is crucial for understanding the network's data throughput and can help in identifying performance issues, especially when block sizes grow too large or remain consistently small.  
Value: size of each block in bytes.

## State Block  Processing Time  

*cometbft_state_block_processing_time_bucket*  

Measures block processing time. Records the time the node takes to process a block, which helps to evaluate its efficiency.
These metrics are fundamental for monitoring and diagnosing the performance and status of the node in the network.  
Value: histogram representing block times

## Chain Size  

*cometbft_consensus_chain_size_bytes*

This metric shows the cumulative size of the blockchain as it grows over time, accounting for all blocks, transactions, and state data. Understanding the chain size helps track data storage requirements and manage resources, especially for nodes with limited storage capacity.  
Value: size of the blockchain in bytes

## Late Votes   

*cometbft_consensus_late_votes*

This metric captures instances where the node receives votes that are considered "late," meaning they belong to earlier stages of the consensus process. The presence of late votes can indicate network delays, synchronization issues, or potential inefficiencies in message propagation. Monitoring this helps in diagnosing network health and ensuring that nodes are maintaining timely consensus participation.  
Value: number of votes received by the node that correspond to previous heights and rounds than the nodeâ€™s current state.

## Proposal Receive Count  

*cometbft_consensus_proposal_receive_count*

This metric measures the total count of block proposals that the node has received over time. The proposals are annotated with their status, indicating whether they were accepted or rejected by the consensus process. Monitoring this helps in understanding the node's participation in the consensus mechanism and provides insights into the efficiency and reliability of the proposal process within the network. It is particularly useful for diagnosing any issues with block proposal acceptance rates.  
Value: total number of proposals received by the node since the process started, categorized by status ('accepted' or 'rejected').

## Begin Blocker Duration

*cosmos_begin_blocker*  

This metric measures the time taken to execute the begin blocker for various modules (e.g., distribution, mint, slashing, staking, upgrade). Begin blockers are executed at the start of each block to update the blockchain state and apply necessary logic before transactions are processed. The metric provides different quantiles (0.5, 0.9, 0.99) to show the distribution of execution times for each module. Monitoring this metric helps assess the performance of each module and identify potential bottlenecks that may impact the speed of block processing.
Value: duration of the begin blocker execution for different modules in the Cosmos SDK.

## End Blocker Duration  

*cosmos_end_blocker*  

This metric measures the time taken to execute the end blocker for different modules (e.g., evmstaking, gov, staking) within the Cosmos SDK. End blockers are critical functions that are run at the end of each block in the blockchain to finalize state changes and apply governance, staking, and other processes. The metric uses different quantiles (0.5, 0.9, 0.99) to show the distribution of execution times, providing insights into the efficiency of the end blockers.   
Value: duration of the end blocker execution for different modules in the Cosmos SDK

## Token Distribution and Staking
_________________________________

## Staking Delegate  

*cosmos_staking_delegate*

Measures how many times users have delegated tokens to validators, showing staking activity on the network.

## Staking Undelegate  

*cosmos_staking_undelegate*

Displays the total number of undelegate events that have occurred in the network.  
Value: number of times delegations have been withdrawn.

## Staking Redelegate  

*cosmos_staking_redelegate*

Displays the total number of redelegate events that have occurred in the network.
Value: number of times staking delegations have been reallocated from one validator to another.

## Staking Undelegate Transactions   

*cosmos_tx_msg__cosmos_staking_v1beta1_MsgUndelegate*  

Tracks the number of undelegation transactions initiated in the Cosmos staking module. Displays the total amount of tokens undelegated

## Staking Queue Depth  

*evmstaking_queue_depth*  

Monitors the depth of the staking queue in an EVM-based staking system. A queue depth of zero means that all staking requests have been processed and there are no outstanding transactions. Monitoring this metric is important for understanding the network's ability to handle staking requests efficiently and identifying any delays or congestion in the staking process. A growing queue depth may signal potential bottlenecks in processing staking transactions.  
Value: number of pending staking or delegation requests waiting to be processed
